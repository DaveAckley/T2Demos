Tue Mar  9 07:01:43 2021 OK, let's try to get the 2D printer working
for a T2 Demo.  Main issue is seeding: How shall we come up with an
initial object to get printed?

We'd like it to be obviously random-y and grown-looking, so it's clear
we're copying a 'frozen accident' rather than a structure that we
could have just regenerated identically from scratch.

So how about like a Frobworld grass structure, maybe with rapidly
evolving colors to make it more fun?  Maybe decay into a cross of
grass or something, to help ensure we do get some growth.
