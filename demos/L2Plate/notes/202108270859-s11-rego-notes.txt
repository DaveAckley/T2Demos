Fri Aug 27 09:00:03 2021 OK so we have a bunch of
stuff starting to work here, with no local notes
file bad bad.

[1:

Fri Aug 27 09:01:28 2021 Importing some bits from
other notes files:

    [:

    Sun Aug 22 06:31:57 2021 So Payload (whatever it's
    called)

    A tag

    quark Carrier {
      //// Carrier API
      virtual Bool hasPayload() ;
      virtual Payload & examine() ; //< must not fail if hasPayload
    }

    quark Payload {
    }

    quark PayloadT(Unsigned cTAG_BITS, Unsigned cDATA_BITS) : Payload {
    }

    [:

    Sun Aug 22 10:48:10 2021 But are we going to have
    the put-together-multiple-pieces or not?  That
    goes to whether 'in-place' payload execution makes
    sense or not.

    PRO IN-PLACE

     - Can use ew.getSiteNumber(UrSelf&)

    Fri Aug 27 02:04:03 2021 Where are we?

     - We've got BitStorage.ulam with the minimum
       ingredients working.

     - We've demoed a 'persistent transient' using
       BitStorage.recast

     - We have *not* demoed a persistent transient
       that's larger than 71 bits, though

     - We have a start at Spork.ulam but no code uses

     - Let's make some Spork code uses.

Fri Aug 27 10:48:03 2021 OK so, we now have:

 - MyElement successfully gather-scatters a 222
   bit Zong transient and thereby makes it
   persistent.

 - But the gather/scatter is one-off code in
   MyElement.  Can we lift that somewhere anywhere
   else?  Challenge is the iteration, and
   believing the bits

How about a new API 'transient Persistent' :) ?

We'd like to add a checksum feature to a
more-automated gather/scatter, so underlying plate
healing up will likely be detected.[3:

Fri Aug 27 11:13:46 2021 Which all loops us back
to the foundational question:

 - How do we identify the contributing bit chunks
   and their proper positions in the bitstorage?

If we trusted our checksum we might even just skip
ensuring that the contributed bit chunks actually
cover the entire Persistent, hmm.

Sun Aug 29 20:24:42 2021 So unfortunately I
switched to 202108201451-level-two-plate-notes.txt
by accident so I've copied that into this dir and
will continue there.  (But 'transient Persistent'
with checksumming is finally starting to work.)
