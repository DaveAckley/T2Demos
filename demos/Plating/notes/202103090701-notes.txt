Tue Mar  9 07:01:43 2021 OK, let's try to get the 2D printer working
for a T2 Demo.  Main issue is seeding: How shall we come up with an
initial object to get printed?

We'd like it to be obviously random-y and grown-looking, so it's clear
we're copying a 'frozen accident' rather than a structure that we
could have just regenerated identically from scratch.

So how about like a Frobworld grass structure, maybe with rapidly
evolving colors to make it more fun?  Maybe decay into a cross of
grass or something, to help ensure we do get some growth.

Tue Mar  9 07:16:46 2021 So, where's the 2D printer code??

Wed Mar 10 10:04:32 2021 OK, so we

 - unrotted the 2D printer code and got it working,

 - created FrobGrass.ulam to grow out a shape to print, and

 - got the grass 'root' to issue random reproduce-in-direction cmds.

And it's working, sort of, but with a ton of failed repros and long
timeouts, as the random repro attempts are highly likely to crash into
each other.

So my goal now is to make a 'probe phase' that happens between the
GROW and COPY phases, that emits a 'probe particle' from the head
commander which scans forward checking for sufficient empty space
based on the measured size of the object to be copied.

The probe somehow returns a 'occupied' vs 'open' indicator to the head
commander, which then either miscarries or advances to the COPY phase
as before.[3:

Wed Mar 10 15:08:12 2021 OK so let's push on probe ideas.  We've got a
mid-repro object here.  The (to-be) head commander is at (3,3); the
(to-be) tail commander is at (9,8); both see the max as (9,10).  The
spot just dead ahead of the head commander would be (2,3) in these
coords.  Suppose we put a probe there and told it it was at (9,3), and
told it to flood probe based on a (9,10) max.

Now it's all messed up because I decided to have the head commander at
(3,Y) instead of (0,Y) so there's going to be some weird offsets and
stuff.  But pushing on for now.

Or take a simpler case, just a 3x3 hollow Block, heading west (the
'native' direction).  We have

  headCommander mLocation (3,3)  mMax (9,7)
  tailCommander mLocation (9,5)  mMax (9,7)

implied NW corner (3,1)
implied NE corner (9,1)
implied SE corner (9,7)
implied SW corner (3,7)

And we'll need something like double the x to grow into.  Say our
'probe box' size is ..

Wed Mar 10 15:48:00 2021 Why again, o why, did we do this

  constant SCoord cORIGIN_X = 3u;
  constant SCoord cORIGIN_Y = 1u;

in UGridContent.ulam?

If we switch

Thu Mar 11 10:17:52 2021 OK so we have a Probe thing flooding a
plausible box ahead of the copy path, and we need to decide how to
deal with it while we copy.

Actually, maybe we should simplify it first.  Right now it's
maintaining a parent tree, but all we really need is a root flag..
